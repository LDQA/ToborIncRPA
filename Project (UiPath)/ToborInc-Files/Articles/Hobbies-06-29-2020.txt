Advancement, promotions and raises are often viewed as the ultimate success in our society. It’s not uncommon to meet people who seemingly have no outside interests because they’re just too focused on their job. The problem is, for the vast majority of people, the work they do on a daily basis isn’t terribly enjoyable.

Or it could be ambitious, like learning a new language. It's the type of goal that enriches your life, helps you develop new skills and gives you a sense of purpose outside your job.
