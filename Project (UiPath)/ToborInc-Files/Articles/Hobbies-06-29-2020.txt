Advancement, promotions and raises are often viewed as the ultimate success in our society. It’s not uncommon to meet people who seemingly have no outside interests because they’re just too focused on their job. The problem is, for the vast majority of people, the work they do on a daily basis isn’t terribly enjoyable. And by focusing solely on their job, they miss out on a crucial element of a fulfilling life and career—personal goals. 
When I say “personal goals” I don’t mean, “I’m going to double my sales quota this quarter.” I’m talking about goals that have nothing to do with work. It could be as simple as reading more. Or it could be ambitious, like learning a new language. It's the type of goal that enriches your life, helps you develop new skills and gives you a sense of purpose outside your job.
