Scotland goalkeeper Craig Gordon has signalled the end of his Celtic career as he bid farewell to the club on social media.
The 37-year-old had been offered a new contract on much-reduced terms but has decided to accept a new challenge.

Birthday boy Kevin De Bruyne set Manchester City on the road to the FA Cup semi-finals from the penalty spot as the holders cruised past Newcastle at St James’ Park.
The 29-year-old’s first-half spot-kick gave the visitors the lead, if not one their dominance deserved, at the break and minutes after substitute Dwight Gayle had been guilty of a glaring miss when presented with an opportunity to level, Raheem Sterling made it 2-0 in the 68th minute.

One minute later Sterling curled home a delightful effort to seal City’s progress and set up a semi-final against Arsenal. 
All four of this year’s Cup quarter-finals, all played behind closed doors, were won by the away team — the first time that has happened since 1987.
