Jio is reportedly offering free 2GB high-speed daily data benefit with a validity of four days to select users once again. It is notably the fourth consecutive month when the telecom operator is offering the promotional data pack. The last such offer came in May, though there are references showing identical benefits in place for some Jio users in April and March as well. It is important to point out that Jio isn't providing the additional high-speed data to all its users. This means that you may not be a part of the list of users who're getting the free data pack.
The add-on data pack with additional 2GB high-speed daily data access is said to be available alongside the existing data allocation. This means that the users will not only get plan's data allocation but the extra 2GB high-speed data benefit as well.
