At WWDC this week, Apple unveiled one of the first uses of its U1 chips These chips, which utilise a wireless technology called ultra-wideband (UWB), are referred to by Apple as “GPS at the scale of your living room”. Or you could call it Bluetooth on steroids.
Apple’s U1-chipped iPhones will now be able to serve as digital car keys to wirelessly unlock and start your car. NFC digital car keys are not new, Samsung has its own version, but they require you to get your phone out and physically tap the door to unlock. This new UWB method (that also uses NFC) means that soon your car will know you are approaching and will be able to unlock the vehicle before you get to the door.
